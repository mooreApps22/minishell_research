## Shell Requirments:

	display a PROMPT when waitng for a new commmand
	have working history
	search & launch the right executable
		based on the PATH variable
		OR using a relative path
		OR using a absolute path
	avoid using more than ONE GLOBAL VARIABLE to indicate a received signal
		the signal handler won't access your main data struct
		FORBIDDEN: Global Variable must provide the number of received signal. Nother else.
			- using norm type structures in a global scope is forbidden.
	Not interpret UNCLOSED QUOTES or SPECIAL CHARACTERS which are not required by the subject
		- '\' or ';' 
	Handle single quote	
		- should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta characters in the quoted sequence
	Handle double quote
		- should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta characters in a quoted
			- expect for '$'
	Implement redirection
		- '<' should redirect input
		- '>' should redirect output
		- '<< [delimiter]' read the input until the a LINE containing the [delimiter] is seen
			- doesn't have to update the history
		- '>>' should redirect output in append mode
	Implement pipes '|'
		- the output of each command in the pipeline is connect ot the input of the next command via a pipe
	Handle ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
		- ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values
	Handle '$?'
		- which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline
	Interactive mode:
		- ^C : displays a new prompt on a new line 
		- ^D : exits the shell
		- ^\ : does nothing
	Shell must have following BUILTINS
		- echo w/ option -n
		- cd w/ only a relative or absolute path
		- pwd w/ no options
		- export w/ no options
		- unset w/ no options
		- env w/ no options or arguments
		- exit w/ no options
	The readline() function can cause memory leaks
		- Don't have to fix them
		- You're code cannot have memory leaks.
	Stick to the requirements don't worry about any not required
		- take bash as a reference
